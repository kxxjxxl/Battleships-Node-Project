You can see the demo app running [here](https://nc-simple-battleship.now.sh).

This game is a simple game of battleship, designed for 2 players. Each players will set up 5 different battleships on their grid. Players will then take turns hitting each other's grid to try to sink their battleships. When one person sinks all of opponent's battleships, that player will be victorious.

This game has 4 main flow:

- Initial Screen
  - Where you will enter the name of participants
- SetUp Screen
  - Where each players will set up their battleships
  - As of current state, this game is meant to be played on a single window. You will need to kindly ask the other player to not look at your screen while setting up the board.
- Battle Screen
  - Where each players will take turns trying to hit the opponent's battleships.
- Win Screen
  - Where the winner is displayed, and you can chose to restart the game.



In this project I designed:
- make 5 draggable ships
- rotate the ships prior to dragging
- make the computer take random goes
- display results based on who has sunk whos ship
- display the winner

This project front end and animations were designed with Javascript, HTML and CSS.
